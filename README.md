# About
Messy is an app I made to help me with my downloads hoarding problem. Since I keep most of the things I download stay in that folder for months it has become a nightmare to navigate and find files.

And so here is __Messy__, the fix for my problem. The app will create a couple of folders for a few categories of files. Every time a new file is downloaded inside of the Downloads folder, Messy will detect what kind of file it is and sort it into a category to keep things organized and out of your way.

Messy currently works on Windows 10 & 11, and should work on linux as well. Mac support is not guaranteed because I don't own a mac device to test it.

###### `p.s. if you own a mac and are willing to help with the project, you're more than welcomed!`

# Usage
Guide to using Messy.

## Application (with installer)
Get the latest installer for you OS from [`releases/latest`](https://github.com/4ngel2769/messy-file-organizer/releases/latest) and go through the installation steps. After running, the app will start in the background. Settings can be accessed from the taskbar icon. 

You have the options to:
- View the logs
- Open the configuration file
- Pause/resume file monitoring (`will stop moving files while paused`)
- Enable/disable autostart (`Windows only`)
- Reload configuration file

<!-- ### Windows -->
<!-- ### Linux -->

## Python script
Run the app using the script.py only.
### Requirements
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed in your environment by running:
```py
pip install pyinstaller pystray pillow watchdog plyer
```

```zsh
# Windows Terminal and Linux/*nix-like systems
git clone https://github.com/4ngel2769/messy-file-organizer.git
cd messy-file-organizer
```

                 [-ra RETRY_ATTEMPTS] [-rd RETRY_DELAY]

Monitor and organize your Downloads folder.

                        Path to the log file

                        Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

                        Delay between retry attempts in seconds
```

### Desktop (script)
Run this in your terminal:
```zsh
python script.py
```
Messy will not start in the background and can be used as if it was installed.



# Compiling from source
Guide to compiling the python script into an executable.

## Windows (compiling)
Navigate to the folder where the `script.py` is and open your terminal.
Run these commands to create the executable:
```zsh
# creates the .spec file
pyi-makespec \script.py
# Customize the .spec file as needed

# compiles the executable in ./dist/script.exe
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=mfo.ico .\script.spec
```

## Linux (compiling)
Use the same steps in [Windows](#windows-compiling)

## macOS (compiling)
